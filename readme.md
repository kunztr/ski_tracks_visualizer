### Ski Tracks Visualizer

This is a simple script that takes gpx files and displays them on an html map using Folium.

GPX files were generated using an app called Ski Tracks.

The main function prints all gpx files in the 2020-21 directory.

The print_all function prints all gpx files in the gpx_files directory.
